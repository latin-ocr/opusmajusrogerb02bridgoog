PERSPECYIVAE PARS PRIMA: DfST. III. 25

et lineae c et d, quae trahuntur versus interius oculi, sunt
in lateribus nervi uveae, inter quas lineas est foramen
uveae‚ secundum quod est versus fundum oculi. Super
quod foramen componitur vitreus, ut patet: nam apertura
harum linearum terminatur ad extremitates portionis vitrei, et
distantia ejus est inter c et d, et haec distantia inter latera
nervi repletur humore vitreo usque ad nervum communem in
superficie cerebri; nervus tamen iste, in quo est haec ⁸nia
humoris vitrei se diffundit et expandit in circuitu vitrei et
glacialis et albuginei‚ usque ad foramen uveae anterius m a,
quod opponitur foramini suo interiori, quod est c d. Deinde
sequitur cornea, et postea consolidativa, ut vocatum est in
figura¹.

¹ It need not be said that the drawing here given is not intended by Bacon
as a picture of anatomioal structuras, but as a geometrioal diagram representing
the various curvatures of the ocular media.

Tne technical terms used by him need a few words of explanation. Con-
mlr'dateiaa meam, generally speaking, the Sclerotic, the opaque strong fibrous
tunic cover-ing the greater part of the globe of the eye, and uniting in front
with the transparent cornea But Batonis not quite consistent in the use of
this term, since, in cap. ii, he seems to use ir as comprehending‚ in addition to
the Selerotic, the musculas and other tissues filling the bony cavity of the orbit.
(Alhazen’s description of it is, ‘pinguedo alba quae implet concavum ossis.‘)
Uaea, as used by him, and also by Vesalius three hundred years afterwards, is the
Choroid‚ inclusive of the Iris. The resemblance of the globe of the eye, when
the Selerotic is removed, to a dark grape plucked from the stalk, suggested the
name : the opening where the stallr had been attached representing the pupit
Glaea'afris includes the vitreous humour and the lens: the former being called
vulnus humor, the latter anfen'or glaciales or sometimes, antmias graaale, or
again humor crystallinus. Humor albugineus answers to what is now called
the aqueous humour. Tela araneae appears to denote, in a somewhat confused
way, the ciliary processa of the choroid, aud also the capsule of the lens ; or at
least the anterior portion of this capsule.

lt will be observed that by centres, Bacon means centra of curvature. Thus
the concave surface formed in the vitreous humour by the lens has its central
point in the anterior part of the eye. Τὴε centres for the cornea and the
anterior surface of the lens are identical. The centre for the globe of the eye
(um) is somewhat anterior. Throughout the whole of this description, Bacon
ln the main follows Alhazen. (Cf. Alhaz. Opt. i. cap. 4, 5.) See, however,
Alhazen's remark quoted on p. ra. Galen was well known to the Arabs in the
ninth century through the translations of Thabit ben Corra and others. Note
that Alhaaeu is alten called by Bacou, auctor Perspectivae.
