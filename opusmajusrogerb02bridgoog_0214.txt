SCIENTIA EXPERIMENYALIS. 195

fractiones veniunt ad hanc figuram. Sed non possunt esse
tres in aspersione facta in radiis, sed una tantum ς et tamen
eadem figura accidit sicut in coelo; quapropter non est causa
hujusmodi fractionis

Postremo ¹, quare non dabunt pyramidem rotundam, sed Circular
figuram assimilatam curvae superficiei pyramidis rotundaeiissssfffefthe
non enim secundum legem fractionis erit hoc, quia fractio
pyramidem rotundam habet facere regularem, quia fractio
omnium radiorum cadentium in unam circulationem corporis
sphaerici est ad angulos aequales, et ideo non incurvabitur
magis in una parte qnam in altera, et erit omnino regularis
figurae et uniformis N ec a roratione potest esse haec cur·
vitas, quia roratio non est talis figurae, sed est globus ex
stillicidiis infinitis compositus pyramidalis figurae rotundae
secundum eos, et ideo non est ratio illius figurationis per
hunc modum.

Quaerenda² est igitur alia rati03 et potest dici quod necesse

est quod sit in figura arcuali circulari. Nam secundum diversi·

tatem situs rei respectu lucis apparet diversus color, ut in collo
columbae. Cum igitur idem color in uno circulo iridis apparet

base. Bacon sometimes tries to popularize his scientific language, for the
benefit it may be supposed of the Pope to whom he was writing.

¹ J. has fractionis postremae. 0. has postremo, which begins a new
argument.

¹ The reasoning in this paragraph is a remarkable combination of observa·
tion and inferente. The eolonrs in the bow do not shift like those on the dove's
neck. ln the ease of the dove, this shifting of colour is caused by varying
incidence of light ln the ease of the bow, therefore, the permanence of each
colour throughout the whole arch indicates that the incident and refiected
angles are constant. 'lherefore all parts of the how must be similarly situated
with regard to the eye and the sun. But from this it follows that the bow must
he of circulor form.

'lhe question raised in the succeeding paragraph is one that admitted of no
solution till Snell and Desoartes had discovered that the direction of the re·
fracted ray varied not with the angle of incidente but with the sine of the angle
of incidence. Applying this law to the rainbow Descartoe ‘showed that the
rays which, after two refractions and a reflection, come to the eye at an angle of
aboutforty-one degrees with their original direction,are farmore densethan those
in any other position. He shewed also that the existence and position of the
oecondary how resulted from the same laws! See Descartae, unone, Discours
viii; and Whewell, Her. oslnduct. Scr‘ences, vol. ii. p. πῃ (ed 1857). Bacon’s
attempt to explain the facts is of course a failure, as every other attempt must
have heca till the ‘law of sines' was discovered
