sacerdotes habent, et conveniunt in aliquibus ordinationibus,
et congregantur in unum locum horis debitis pro solemni-
tatibus faciendis. Nam campanas habent magnas sicut
Christiani ut prius habitum est¹. Differunt etiam Idololatrae
a Paganis. Nam idololatrae manufacta colunt: Pagani vero

Quartus est Saracenorum. Quintus Judaeorum. Sextus

'This is the reading of 0.: llangu Khan is of course meam. The account
of this religious parliament will be found in pp. 352-360 of Rubruquis'
narrative3 it is tull of interest There was a very large guthering of
liestorian Christiana, of hfusnlmans and of Buddhists, here called Tuini‚ each
bringing their wisest as champions. Violent or contentious language was
strictly forbidden under pain of death. Three arbiters, a Christian, a blahon-
medan, and a Buddbist‚ were appointed. Rubruquis‚ with some difficulty,
persuaded the Nestorians to let him begin the conference with the subject of
the unity and omnipotence of God, against which the Buddhists pleaded the
existence of evil ‘Si deus tuus talis est ut dieis, quare fecit dimidietatem
rerum malaml falsum est, dixi: qui fecit malum non eatDeus. Et omnia quae·
cunque suntbonasunt. Ad istud verbnm mirati sunt omnes Tuini, et redigerunt
in scripto illud tanquam falsum vel impossibile! Rubruquis, evadiug this point,
forces them ιο admit that no one of their own gods was omnipotent, on which
all the blahommedans present burst into laughter. These Mahommedans seem
not ιο bave been of the strictestg for when the Nestorium began to controvert
their views, they remarked, We admit that your law is true, we confess the
trutb of everythingin the gospe13 therefore we do not care to dispute with you.
They declared, moreover‚ thatin all their prayers they asked that their death
might be like that of the Christiana.

On the following day lfangu had a friendly interview with Rubruquie, but
told him ιο return to Europe. He assured him that he too believed in one
God: but that as a man's hand had several lingers, so God had given to men
various rules of life. To the Christians he gave their scriptures; to the Tartars
their divinem. The Tartara were, however, he remarked, more obedient to
their authority than the Christians to theirs. Τὴο letters given by Mangu for
delivery ιο King Louis were similar to those which Mangu's predecessor Kuyulr
had sent by Car-pini ιο inuocem lv,
