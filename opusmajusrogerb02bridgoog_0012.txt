PREFACE. ix

After the conclusion of this passage, J. then proceeds with what is given
in vol i on the authority of other MSS. (P. and Ο.) as the opening
of Part lV. (vol ip. 97), Manifesto (sic) quod multae et praeclarae radices
sapientiae dependent ex potestate linguarum (et seq.), as far as the words
ac per contrarium hujus scientiae notitia (last line of p. 97), and then stops.
On this there follow the first words of Distinctio Secunda, p. 109, Quod de
scientiis jam ostensum est (et seq.).

The Hebrew passage, following on the Hebrew alphabet (vol i. p. 75), is
so incorrectly written, whether as regards the Hebrew words, their trans-
literation or the latin translation of them, that it was omitted from my
text V, the MS. next to be spoken of, offers a complete contrast in this
respect, as the mnexed photographic reproduction will show.

J. has other hults of 2 kind which make it difficolt to believe that
this MS. can have been prepared under Bacon's superintendence. Thus
theword gnomone (p. 103,l 18) is written by him cognomone ; p. 161, l. 22,
engonis for heptagonis ; p. 222, 1. 13, Yndorum for Numerorum, and other
blunders of the same kind ln the displaced passage above mentioned on
the conversion 2ηά repression of the heathen, the text, as will be seen from
tbe fontaneo, isentremely corrupt There are some remarkable omissions.
That of the table, p. 208, with the commentaryon it, is common to J.with V.
But there is another of eight lines on p. 138, and a still more important
one of five pagos (pp. 231-6). On f. 84 and on f. 148 there is a drawing
of a ruan's head in the margin of the page. As Bacon speaks of his practice
of using this sign to call attention to certain passages (see Op. Tert. ed.
Brewer, p ott these instances have been thought to prove Bacon's
supervision of this MS. The evidence is quite inadequate to such 2
nuuclusion.

Vatican 4086, here spoken of as V, is a beautifully written MS. (parch-
ment) in 74 folios, of the first quarter of the 14th century. A photographic
nopy ofit, and also of the unpublished fragment previously mentioned, has
been given to the Museum by Dr. Gasquet (Add 35,253). lt includes the
first 376 pagus of vol. i, ending with the words principalem scripturam,
which close the geographical secuon V. is without rubrics‚ but leaves
specus for them which on the whole correspond to the divisions in J. lt
bllows J. in omitting the last chapter of Part l., and the table on p. 208,
and like J, it passes from Part 111. to Part lV. without clearly marking the
divisim The mathenratical section begins simply as a new paragraph
trith the words Secundum impedimentum est majus isto, and continues as
iuJ. to the words praesentis speculationis at the foot of page 108, proceeding
then with Quod de Scientiis ostensum est, as on p. ¹09· The passage
as to conversion 2ηά subjugation of the heathen is not contained in V, and
