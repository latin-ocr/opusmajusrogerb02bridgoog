there is no indication, like that given in J, of the opening to Pan 1v. which
is adopted in the ed. of 1733 and in my own.

The principal value of V. is that it restores to us passages which
in J. are destroyed or made illegible by fite, and that the Hebrew
sentences are more accurately transcribed. ln the scientific portions
of Part lV. there are many errors and omissions which render it
of less value than J. or Ο. or than Ρ., which is next to be spoken of. ln
the thirty-two pages‚ for instance (197-228), there are eight omissions,
amounting to 107 words, all of which interfere fatally with the sense. lt
has nrany mistakes, moreover, in the computations of astronomical magni-
tudes.

A copy of this Vatican MS. will he found in the Paris Library (Nouvelles
Aequisitions latines 1715). lt is complete, except that the Hebrew passages
are omitted, though a place is left for them. lt is probably of the
beginning of the sixteenth century,

Royal7 Fvii (here spoken of as P.) contains a complete copy of the
fourth part of the Opus Majus. lt appears to be of the first half of the
fourteenth century, and is very boldly and clearly written, in 6 folios of
four columns. On the margin at the foot of f. rob and f. 11 isa long
quotation from Albertus Magnus in a very different handwriting, but also
clearly of the fourteenth century, on the subject of the tides, which will be
found among the additional notes (p. 139).

On f. 62b, after the words principalem scripturam (p. 376), there follows,
in a later handwriting, Hic sequi debet tractatus qui incipit, Post locorum
descriptionem (cf. vol. i. pp. 376-403)‚ And on f 68 this treatise will be
found in another hand of the same pen'od3 another fragment, De visu et
speculis, occupying the intervening space. (lt has been held by some critics
that it should be regarded as part of the introductory work called by Bacon
Opus Minus, or Secundum, of which we possess other fragments. lt is
addressed to the Pope, and contains references to the various parts of the
Opus Majus. On the whole it appeared best to leave it in the position
assigned to it in O.) The text of this astrologioal section in P. is
extremely imperfect, very inferior to the corresponding text in Ο.

ln P. Part lV, is clearly defined as a separate section of the work. The
rubric is, Pars quarta in qua ostenditur potestas mathematicae in scientiis et
rebus et occupationibus hujus mundi, habens distinctiones. Prima habet
tria capitula. ln primo datur intentio istius partis. Like V., it contains
the section (pp, 269-285) on the correction of the Calendar. ln the
scientific portions of the work, and especially in arithmetical calculatione, it
is much more accurate than V.

The above are the only MSS. known to me containing the fourthpart that
