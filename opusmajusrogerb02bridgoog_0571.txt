552 MULTIPLICATIO SPECIERUM

post eclipses stellarum accidit3 nam primo debilitatam habent
lucem, tanquam similem et speciem, et post hoc claram et
completam. Cujus signum est quod luna videtur in eclipsi
rubea, et quod exit in umbra3 et quando est in umbra habet
speciem lucis debitae quae venit de luce transeunte per latera
et fines umbrae, sicut postea¹ magis explanabitur.

Veruntamen sciendum quod species solis quae est de vera
ejus substantia non potest compleri in luna et stellis, licet in
eis fiat: quia tunc oporteret lumen et stellas fieri solem, quod
est impossibile. Lux enim est quantitas communis soli et
stellis et igni, licet magis sit in sole3 et ideo potest species
lucis compleri in luna et stellis, et non species similis soli;
quia sol et luna et stellae durant in sua substantia, sicut
· posterioribus erit manifestum. Et lux non est de eorum
substantia, sed est aeris communis eis et igni ; licet aliquando
solebant dicere lucem esse formam substantialem solis et
stellarum. Sed hoc est falsum².

¹ Cf. pp. 104-5 of this volume. lt is probable, however, that the reference

here, and a few lines lower down, is to a subsequent section of the work, of
which the present treatise is but a portion.

² The treatise here ends with thewords ‘Explicit tractatus fratris R. Bacoun
de multiplicatione specierum! ln another and more recent handwriting the
words are added, ¹ Post istum tractatum sequi debet perspectiva! The fact that
this treatise was sent to the Pope at the same time as the Opus Majus accounts

for its having been incorporated into that work by the transcriber of Ο. (followed
by Π). Though there are references in it, like that on p. 408, which imply
that it was a portion of an encyclopaedic treatise, partly written, partly projected‚
yet there are other references, like that on p. 534, to the Opus MaJirs itself.
These l incline to regam as glosses‚ added perhaps by Bacon's pupils or
transcribers.

The scholastic style of the work contrasts strongly with that of the Opus
Mnjus, which, as we know, was a Persicasr'o Prmmbula. lt has been less
studied than Bacon's other worlrs, not so much from its difficulty as from the
notion that it was a mere reoast of Aristotelian Physica, and from¹ the further
notion that Aristotelian Physics were not worth studying. Both of these
positions, l venture to think, will be abandoned, when the same attention shall
have been given to the history of science that hasbeen given during the last
half century to other departments of Evolution. What lifts Bacon's discussions
upon force to a higher level than that of barren dialectical debate is, that they
were animated by constant reference to a living and growing science due to the
later Greeks, and still more to the Arabiane, the science of Optic, including the
study of theorgans of vision and perception no less than that of the force acting on
them. For Bacon the radiation of light was a type of all other radiant forces.
