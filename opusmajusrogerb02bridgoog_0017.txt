the Opus Majus as a whole is its existence in the MS. here spoken of as Ο.
0., as already stated, can hardly be considered earlier than 144o lf it
were not genuine, the alternative would be to suppose it an artificial
compilation of Baconian treatises made at'some date between the end of
the thirteenth and the middle of the fifteenth century. Against this
somewhat gratuitous supposition is to be set, first, the interna] evidence to
be found in the work itself ; secondly, the extemal evidence den'ved from
the Opus Minus or Secundum, and the Opus Tertium.

The intemal evidence consists (a) in frequent references to Pope
Clement IV. to whom the work was addressed. The letter of the Pope to
Bacon requesting him to send to him the results of his researches was copied
by Wadding from the Vatican archives‚ and has been verified by myself after
inspection of the original document. ln a work written subsequently to
the Opus Majus (Compendium studii, Brewer‚ p. 424), Bacon mentions
Clement IV. as the Pope in question. Among these references to the
Pope in the Opus Majus may be mentioned vol. i. pp. 1, 12, 17, 23, 72, 81,
285, 376-7‚ 403, vol. ii. p. 377. They are found in the earlier MSS. no less
than in the later.

The second branch of internal evidence (b) consists in the numerous
cross-references from one part of the Opus Majus to another. Thus Part
11. is spoken of (vol. i. 33) as a continuation of Part 1. F requent references
to Part 11. are made in Part vlt, as vol. ii. pp. 225, 229, 233, and 237.
The opening sentence of Part lll. refers to the results of Part ll. ; that of
Part IV. to Part lll.;that of Part V. to Parts Ill. and 1V.;that of Part
Vl. to Parts ΙΙΙ, lV., and V. ; that of Part Vll. to Parts ΙΙ, lll., IV.‚ V.‚ and
Vl. Part Vl. is spoken of in Part lV. (vol. i. p.213); Part Vll. in Part 1.
(i. p. 57); and numerous references are made in Part Vll. to Part lV.
(vol-ii·w·369‚370‚371‚380‚389)·

To this intemal evidence is to be added the extemal proof derived from
the Opus Minus and the Opus Tertium. For the first it is sufficient to
refer to pp. 316-20 of Brewer's edition (Rolls series 1859), including both
these treatises. In the case of the second the evidence is more abundant.
Reference to Part 1. will be found in cap. iuti. androsii. ; to Part ll. in cap.
roriii. and iotiv.; to Part ΙΙΙ. in cap. iorv.-iorvii.; to Part IV. in cap.
mcviii-how. ; to Part V. in oap. xii. ; to Part Vl. in cap. xiii. ; to Part Vll. in
cap. xiv. lt may be added that mention is made of the Opus Tertium,
under the title tertia scriptura, in a contemporary marginal note on f 32b.
of V. On the whole, it will be hard to find in the history of literature a
work the authenticity of which rests on a sounder foundation. These, and
other questions of a more doubtful kind wouldbe at once disposed of, could
the original MS. sent in 1267 to Rome be discovered. But of this there is
