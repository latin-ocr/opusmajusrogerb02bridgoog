SCIENTIA EXPERIMENTALIS. 201

Sed haecomnia docet experientia, sicut de iride. Unde Scienrifie
argumenta non certificant haec, sed grandes experientiae per ‘Jffiffi

instrumenta perquiruntur, et per varia necessaria; et ideo mulus

nullus sermo in his potest certificare3 totum enirn dependet decide.
ab experientia. Et propter hoc non reputo me attigisse hic
plenam veritatem; quia nondum expertus sum omnia quae sunt

hic necessaria, et quia in hoc opere procedo via persuasionis,

et ostensionis¹ quae oporteat requiri in studio sapientiae, et

non perviam componendi scripta de ea. Et ideo non pertinet

ad me hac hora dare certificationem impossibilem, sed sub
forma persuadendi de studio sapientiae pertransire.

De circulo vero circa candelam aestimatur quod sit
a vaporibus resolutis a cibis et potibus in mensa; vel quando
aer humidus est potest apparere, aut in vaporibus oculi
humidi generatur distans a candela. Sic igitur quilibet
sapiens de lacili recipiet quod experientia certificat quaestiones
circa has res, et non argumentum. Sed nunc transeo ad
secundam praerogativam istius scientiae experimentalis ².

¹This and the preceding thirteen words omitted in J. This passage is ol
great importante as indicating the purpose and the limitations ol the Opus
Majus.

¹ Tne loregoing chapters must be judged partly as a piece ol scientific research,
partly as a meth0d; as an illustration that is ol Roget Bacon's first prerogativa, the
confirmation ol mathematical reasoning by experiment and obsewation. It will
be noted that these last words are used in the widest sense ς being made appli-
cable, as the first chapter shows, to the drawing ol a geometrical diagram:
an extension ol ordinary use which reminds us οἱ the opening sentences ol
Wallis'An'tlrmaenlta Infinilomm, in which the inductive method is lranklyapplied
to the investigation ol series.

Bacon was led by his method to some sound results. lle begins with a col·
lection ol phenomena, colours in crystals or hall-polished surlaces, in spray
from a mill-wheel, or lrom an oar when lit by the sun, and the like, which, as
Whewell says, ‘are almost all examples os the same kind as the phenomena
under consideration! lle combines astronomical theory with astronomical
observatiou in explaining the connexion between the altitude of the bow and
that ol the Sun. ln his prool that the centre ol the bow, ol the eye, and ot the
Sun are always in one straight line the union ol theory with observationis
equally marked. Tne conclusion that each observet sees adistinet rainbow is
clearly drawn. Not less striking is his discussion ol the form ol the rainbow;
which was pushed as sar towards the truth as was possible at a time when the
law ol variation in the angles ol refractlon was still undiseovered.

With regard to the colours ol the rainbow‚ and indeed with regard to colour
in general, he shared the ignorante, not of his own time only, but ol the three
