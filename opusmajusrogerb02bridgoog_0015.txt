xii PREFA ΟΕ.

ln the Vatican Library (Palatine 828) there is a MS. of Perspectiva
stated in the colophon to have been completed on Sept. 29, 1349, of which
the title is Tractatus perspectivas habens tres partes principales extractus

¹ ex multis auctoribus perspectivae compilatus per fratrem Rogerum Bacon

ordinis fratrum minorum. Pars prima hujus persuasionis babens 9
distinctiones; prima habet capitula 53 primurn est de pulcritudine et
utilitate hujus partis in universali,

The MS. begins: Propositis radicibus sapientiae tam divinae quarn
humanae quae sumuntur penes linguas a quibus scientiae Latinorum sunt
translatae nunc volo radices aliquas discutere quae ex potestate per·
spectivae oriuntur (et seq. as in this edition). Eut the nine distinctions
spoken ol in this MS. are not identical with those ol Reg. and Ο. They
cover the whole os the three parts ol the treatise. Thus Dist iii. cap. i.
appears in this MS. as Dist. ii. cap. 4.; Dist. v. cap. i. as Dist. iii. cap. i.;
Dist. viii. cap. i. as Dist. iv. cap. i.; Dist x. cap. i. as Dist v. cap. i.;
Part ll. Dist. iii. capi. as Dist. vi. (the second distinction ol Part ll. being
omitted). Part ΙΙΙ. Dist. i. is Dist vii3 Part ΙΙΙ. Dist ii. is Dist. viii.;
Part ΙΙΙ, Dist. iii. is Dist. ix.

Other and later MSS. of this portion of the Opus Majus are, Harleian
80, Sloane 2156 ; Magd. Coll, Cambridge, possesses a copy of it ; also St.
Mark's Library, Venice (Lat. 133), and Pan's Bibl. Nat. (Nouv. Fonds
Latins 10260). This last is on paper, beautifully written, ol the sixteenth
century. Combach's edition published in 1614 is said by him to be
founded on “very old Oxford MSS.” What these were he has not told
us; nor can the variants ol this edition be connected with any ol the
MSS. known to us. Some os them probably are of his own devising.

lt thus appears that for the first five parts os the Opus Majus, contain-
ing two thirds of the whole work, early manuscript authority is not wanting.
The case is lar otherwise with the sixth and the seventh parts, for which
we have principally to depend upon Ο. ln Part vl, indeed, some
assistance has been afiorded by the Vatican MS. 4091, to which attention
hasbeen called in the additional notes. lt extends, however, only to the
first third of the section.

For Part Vll. we have, besides 0,, the Royal MS. 8 F ii, here spoken
ol as M. lt is of the early part ol the fisteenth century, perhaps thirty
years older than Ο. But the text is far more corrupt than that of 0, and
it only covers the first 52 pages, not a third partos the section.

Coming to what is here printed as an Appendix to the Opus Majus, the
Multiplicatio Specierum‚ we find again an abundance of manuscript
material. The oldest MS, contemporary with Bacon, is contained in
Royal 7 F viii. ff. 13 (et seq.) preceding the MS. ol Perspectiva already
