PREFACE.

Three motives prompted me, in 1893, to undermke a new edition of
Roget Baoon’s Opus Majus. One was that the sixtb centenary of one of
the earliest and perhaps the greatest of Oxford thinkers was at band Α
seoond reason was that this work brings into prominence the connection of
Greek Scienoe with that of the modern world, through the mediation of the
Atabic Schools of Bagdad and Spain. And thirdly‚ the Opus Majus, when
published in its entirety, appeared to me to present to the world a scheme
of culture contrasting strongly with any that was offered in Bacon’s time
or in the centuries that followed Combining the comparative study of
langrnge with a comprehensive grasp of physiml science, conceiving these
studies as progressive, and yet holding them subordinate to a supreme
ethical purpose, it surpassed any that was put before the world till the
publication of the philosophical and social works of Auguste Comte.

But the work was undertaken with insufficient equipment of expett skill
in decipbering manuscripts ; with the result that, though many errors in the
edition of 1733 were corrected, and especially the fundamental error of
omitting the ethical troetise which completes and crowns the work, yet far
too many were retained Further‚l had not bad the opportunity of con-
sulting the important MS. (Vat. 4086) to which attention was called by Dr.
casque, when in the July issue of the Engl. Hist. Rcview 1897, he
presented an unpublished fragment of Bacon of which more will be said
afterwards. This MS., here called V„ resembles in many important
respects, though by no means in all, the Cottonian MS. Julius D.V. already
noted on p. xv of vol. i. (spoken of there as lul, but in this volume as J.).
J. is the oldest of all known MSS. of the Opus Majus. lt contains much
dat is not found iu the Bodleian MS. (O.); but in the and and 3rd parts
'a is much mutdated by fire. V.‚ though probably not less than thirty years
hterin date, enables us to supply many of the deficiencies of J.

lt was thus necessary that steps should be taken to repair the defecta of
the edition as it stood. 'Ibe Delegates of the Clareudon Press, for whose
