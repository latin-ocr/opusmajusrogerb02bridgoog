only, which fixes its position as part of a larger philosophical worlc
There are certain passages in it not given elsewhere against which the
word supequ't is written in the margin in a contemporary hand Further,
some of the chapters of Pants 11. and 111. are removed from their proper
position: ag, f. 35d is continued on f. 37a, and chapter ir. of Part 11.is
found embedded in Part IV.

later MSS. of the Multiplicatio will be found in Sloane 2156, in Magd
Coll, Cambridge, following on the MS. of Perspectiva already mentioned;
and in the library of St Marlds, Venice (Lat vi. 133), preceding a MS.
of Perspectiva

ln frauting a text from the foregoing MSS. it will be noticed that the
principal difficulty occurs in the transition from Part 111. to Part IV. ln J.
aad also in V., which rank among the oldest (the first being of the thirteenth,
the second of the beginning of the fourteenth century), the distinction
is by no means clearly marked On the other band in Ρ., a MS. not later
than 1350, and in all other MSS. of the fourth Part, the division of this
settion is very distinctly indicated Some clue to this discrepancyis probably
to be found in a remarkable passage occurring in the Baconian fragment
published by Dr. Gasquet in the English Historical Review, July 1897:
Sentiens meam imbecillitatem nihil scribo difficile quod non transeat usque
sd quartum vel quintum exemplar antequam habeam quod intendo. J. and
V. represent perhaps one, or more probably two, of the earlier drafts. J.
appears to represent a somewhat more advanced “state'‘ of the work than V.

There remains the difficulty of accounting for the many curious
imaocuracies in J. ; errors so gross as to render it impossible that the copy
could have been made, as some critics bave supposed that it was made,
under Bacon's superintendence.' To this difficulty Bacon bas himself
wspplied the clue when explaining to the Pope‚ as he does in Opus
Tertium. In the second chapter of that work he speaks of the difficulty of
getting his work transcnbed ε “ It could not,” he said, “ be fairly written out
except by scribes who stood outside our body ; and these would transcribe on
their own account whether l liked it or not, in the way in which writings
are very frequently published in Paris fraudulently.‘' lt is far from
improbable that J, or at any rate the first portion of J., represents one of
these pirated editions.

The question was raised by one of my reviewers, whether there was any
such wod: as the Opus Majus? Although the question seems to carry
scepridsm rather far, rt may be well to answer it. The earliest evidence for
