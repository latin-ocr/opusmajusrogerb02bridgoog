viii PREFA CE.

only a portion of the work. Of these, the oldest, undoubtedly os the
thirteenth century, and possibly written at the very time when Bacon was
composing his work, or very shortly afterwards, is the Cottonian MS. Jul.
D.V. spoken ofin this Appendix as J. lt is a small parchment quarto and
consists of 81 solios, (ff. 71-151b), covering pp. 1-241, l.7 oi the text of
vol. i. ln the last half of Part l., the whole oi Part ll., and the beginning
oi Part lll., it is much injured, some solios being almost entirely destroyed.
Many of the rubrics are illegible: what is left of them show that the first
three parts, as well as the first portion of Part tv, were divided into
Distinctiones as well as Capitula.

ln this MS. the transition from Part lll. to Part lV. is attended with
great confusion. On f. 104, after the passage (p. 96 oi vol. i.) ending,
cum vario sapientiae damno languent, follow the words, Quodque non
avertunt, ideo necessitate compulsi sunt moderni damnum cum vituperio
sustinere, a quibus omnes sancti doctores, philosophi et sapientes antiqui
remanserunt immunes. Tben, without any break beyond an ordinary full
stop and capital, come the words Secundum impedimentum est majus isto,
nam una est scientia qua ignorata nulla alia sciri potest : et qua scita possunt
aliae de sacili edoceri ; et haec fuitin usu omniurn sanctorum doctorum et
philosophorum et sapientum antiquorum propter sui infinitam utilitatem et
pulchritudinem et magnificentiam, et haec est mathematica. Unde totius
studii destructio est negligentia mathematicae. Quoniam qui ignorat
quantitates continuas et discretas et eertun applicationes ad caeteras res et
scientias ignorabit omnia. Et, quod pejus est, omnis homo ignorans boc
suam ignorantiam non potest percipere (et seq. as in vol. i. pp. 97-108‚ as
far as the end oi Distinctio Prima, sed hoc non est praesentis speculationis).
J. then proceeds with the first six words of Distinctio Secunda (vol. i.
p. 109) Quod de scientiis jam ostensum est, and there stops. He then
interpolates a long passage, printed here ior the first time, and given by no
other MS, which is os great importance‚ because it fills up a gap in Part
lll. which would be otherwise inexplicable. On vol. i p. 9² Bacou had
expressed his intention oi describing the value of linguistic studies not
merely (ι) in themselves but (a) for the government of the Christian
commonwealth‚ and (3) t'or the conversion, or (4), it necessary, the
repressiones the heathen. ln the text as it stands, the second os these
topics is left unfinished, the third and fourth are not treated of at all

ln J. the sense, broken off on f. 104 with the words raro sufficiuntis

carried forward ons. 107 with the words raro sufficiunt interpretes ad
intelligentiam plenam, et rarius inveni[un]tur fideles (et seq). This passage,
here restored to its proper place, completes the second subiect, and discusses
in tull the two others.
