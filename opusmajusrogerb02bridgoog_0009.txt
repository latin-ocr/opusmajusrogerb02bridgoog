considerate treatment of the matter l offer my grateful aclmowledgments,
had already spent much money on the work and were unwilling to incur
further expenditure They offered, however, to transfer to me the stock
and copyn'ght. This offer was accepted, and the work, including the
present volume, will in future be sold by Messrs. Williams and Norgate:

A revised text of the first three parts of the Opus Majus is here presented,
based in the main upon V. of which a photographic copy was obtained in
Rome. lt has been carefully collated by Mr. J. Α Herbert of the British
Museum, with J. and also with the Bodleian MS. Digby 235 (here called 0.),
which was entrusted to the Keeper of MSS. of the British Museum for this
purpose. As the footnotes show, the readings of J. and of Ο. have been

in the Additional Notes. Το have repn'nted the whole work in the form
adopted for parts i.-iii. was a task beyond my means, nor did it seem to be

Multzjrllt‘catzb Spect'erum, contained in the early fourteenth century MS,
Add 8786 3 and the Vatican MS. 4091 (denoted X.), for knowledge of
which, as well as of other Vatican MSS.,l have to thank Mr. Bliss‚ has
supplied some important passages of Part Vl, which 0. omits. ·

ln the preface to vol i. pp, xiii-xvii, something was said of the MSS.
of the Opus Majus. Of the most important of those some further details
are subjoined

The Oxford MS. Digby 23 5 (denoted Ο.) is the earliest MS. containing
all seven parts of the Opus Majus. From it, as was stated vol. i. p. xiv,
the Dublin MS. was copied ; the Gale MS. in Trin Coll. Camb. (see
Brewer, Rogeri Bacon Opera lnedita‚ pp. xliii-iv), being a copy of this
