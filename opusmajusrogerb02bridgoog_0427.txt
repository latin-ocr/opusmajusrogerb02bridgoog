408 MULTIPLICATIO SPECIERUM.

here called et secundum essentiam. Recolendum est igitur quod in tertia

specics.

parte1 hujus operis tactum est, quod essentia, substantia,
natura, potestas, potentia, virtus, vis, significant eandem rem,
sed differunt sola comparatione. Nam essentia dicitur secun·
dum se considerata, substantia dicitur respectu accidentis aut
respectu operationis eliciendae, sed natura dicit aptitudinem
operandi, caetera ulteriorem inclinationem. Sed potentia et
potestas sunt idem, et communiter sumuntur respectu opera·
tionis completae vel incompletae. Virtus vero et vis sunt idem,
sed dicunt complementum solum operationis. Et hic loquor
de potentia quae elicit actionem, non de illa quae expedit.
Nam haec est in secunda specie qualitatis; quae vero elicit
est in omnibus activis, et hae sunt substantiae et sensibilia

importance to the metaphor conveyed by it. ln a page of the Opus Tertium,
in which this treatise is referred to, it is spoken of as Tractatus de radiis. And
just as a modern physicist will speak of a ray of light without holding the
emission theory, so Bacon uses the expression speo'as as equivalent to force;
and the multiplicatiori of speaks for the radiation or propagation of force.

¹ The third part of the Opus Musica deals with languagas. ln the fourth
part the question of species is discussed (cf. vol. i. p. 111 et sem), but no such
statement as that in the text is to be found, nor does the fifth part (perspectiva)
contain it. lt is thus clear that this treatise is part ofa larger work in
which questions of physical philosophy were handled. ln the Opus Terfrirm
are to be found several allusions to the present work. Bacon observes (cap.
xi. p. 38, ed. Brewerl: ‘completionem tractatum mitto vobis de hae multiplica·
tione! And again (cap. xxxvi. p. ιη), ‘ln opere primo (i. e. Opm Moybn)
posui multa de hac materia. Et praeter hoc misi tractatum specialem de hoc
negotio ex proposito editum‘ Other references to it will be found on pp. 99,
161, and 227. lt seems probable that tliis treatise, or at least something like
ir, had been already written when Popc Clement's message to Bacon was
delivered. The passage in opus Tertium (p. 13), is not at all decisive to the
contrary. lt only asserta that communication of any writing to outsiders was
forbidden

But what was the larger work of which this treatise was a partl Our

thoughts turn at once to the ‘Scriptum Principale,' so often spoken of by Bacon
as an unaccomplishcd project. Referring to the Introduction for liirther details,
lmay observc here that among the copious extracts given by Emile Charles
from the MS. in the Mazarine library containing the ‘ Communia Naturalium’ of
Bacon, are certain passages implying that this work was begun before 1267.
The subject of Mulh'plicatab Speo'mrmis discussed in it at considerable length,
though less fully than in the treatise now before us, which may possibly be a
later and amplified edition. [mis MS, now numbered 3576, is nearly identioal
with the Br. lfus. ils. Royal, 7 Fvii, as l can testify from inspeetion of both.

Νοίιξίσ are spoken of by Brewer; cf. however his remarks ou 8756 (Additioual,
Br. us.) p. lii.]
