PREFACE. xi

areas earlyas the sourteenth century. ln the fifteenth it was several times
copied Tbe Cottonian MS. Tiberius C.V. has been mentioned in the
Prehce (p. xv). lt covers 7¹ folios (4o119) of the same volume that con-
tainsone ol the principal MSS. of Opus Tertium. There are no rubrics and
no divisions ol chapters. The Correctio Calendan'i, although it will be found
in the Opus Tertium (ff. 4ob-43b) is not given here, nor the concluding
astrologiml treatise. The MS. ends as in V. with the final words of the
Geographia,—principalem Scripturam. lt is apparently of the middle of
the fifteentb century.

Another copy of the fourth part is in the possession of Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge ; and yet another in the Lambeth Library. These are
approximately of the same date as the Cottonian.

Of tbe fifth part ol the Opus Majus (Perspectiva) the most important
MS. is Royal 7 F viii. (fl 47 et seq.) already spoken of on pp. xiii and xv
of tbe Prelace. The rubric, displaced from its proper position, is, Tractatus
perspectivae habens tres partes; prima est de communibus ad caeteras
duas ; secunda pars descendit in speciali ad visionem rectam principaliter3
tertia ad visionem reflexam et stactam. Prima pars habet duodecim
distinctiones. Prima est de proprietatibus istius scientiae et de partibus
animae et cerebri et instrumenti videndi, habens capitula. Primum est de
proprietatibus scientiae hujus.

The treatise begins, Hic aliqua dicenda sunt de perspectiva. Auctores
quidem multi tractant dehac scientia; sed quidam nimis parum, etseq.
as in tbe extract from Combach's edition, quoted in the note to vol. ii.
pp. 1-2. This MS, like the greater part of that which precedes it in the
same volume (ff. 13-46b), isos the t 3th century.

The rubric of tbe second part of Perspectiva is, Hic incipit pars secunda
hujus tractatus, et seq. as in the text of this edition.

The rubric os the third part is simply, Tertia pars perspectivae
principalis.

lt will be noted that 12 distinctions are spoken of in the first part. 0.,
however, speaks of nine only. The two MSS, however, agree in giving
ten distinctions, and they entirely coincide in their contents.

Next in antiquity is the MS. of Perspectiva contained in Add MS.
8786 (a small volume entitled Baconis Opuscula Physica),f. 84 (et seq.).
This MS. is in very small writing, in double columnS, of the early part ol
the t'ourteenth century. It is beaded, Incipit tractatus de modo videndi,
and begins, Quoniam praecipua delectatio nostra est in visu, et lux et color
labent specialem pulcritudinem (et seq.). Chapters are marked by red
letters, but without titles. ot Distinctiones, in the first part, nothing is
said The diagrams are scanty and imperfect.
