Part l. is headed, Pars prima hujus persuasionis in qua excluduntur quatuor
miversales causae tocius ignorancie humane habens quatuor distinciones 3
and begins, Sapiencie perlecta consideratio consistit in duobus Part of
an unfinished lourteenth century MS. (11. 115-148) has boen skilfully
ubodied, the later scribe ending a short quire on 1. 124 b. at the precise
point where the older ingruent begins, and continuing the text 011 f. 148 b.,
which his predecessor had left blank. Part V. ends “veritatem non posset

pp. 471-498 (11. 23 5-248) are misbound and ought to come in the following

The insertion 01 the Multiplicatio Specierum between Parts V. and Vl.
may possibly not have been the original arrangement 01 the volume, since
tlur treetise and Part Vl. both begin new quires. We know irom the
Opus Tertium that the Multiplicatio specierum was intended to be read in
