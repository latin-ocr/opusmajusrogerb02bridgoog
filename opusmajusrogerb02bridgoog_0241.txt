222 OPERIS MAJORIS PARS SEXTA.

non habuit peditum nisi triginta duo millia, et equiturn
quatuor millia et quingent0s; tamen, ut dicit Orosius ad
Augustinum in libro de Ormesta Mundi, inferens hac tam
parva manu bellum universo terrarum orbi, utrum admira-
bilius sit quod vicerit aut quod aggredi ausus fuerit, incertum
est. Primo ergo cum Dario rege congressu sexcenta millia
Persarum prostravit, sed in suo exercitu centum viginti equites
et novem pedites defuere. in secundo vero congressu devicit
quadraginta millia hominum, et de suo exercitu centum triginta
pedites ct centum quinquaginta equites ceciderunt; per hoc
residuum mundi territum facilius subjecit. Sed Orosius dicit,
non minus arte quam virtute Macedonum superavit. Nec
mirum, cum Aristoteles fuerit cum eo in his bellis, ut legimus
in vita Aristotelis. Et etiam Seneca in N aturalibus dicit, quod
mundum vicit Alexander, Aristotele et Callisthene ducibus,
qui magistri ei fuerunt in omni sapientia. Sed Aristoteles
¹ extitit principalis; et facile patet per praedicta quomodo per
vias sapientiae potuit Aristoteles mundum tradere Alexandro.
Et hoc deberet ecclesia considerare contra infideles et rebelles¹

ut parcatur sanguini Christiano. et maxime propter futura
pericula i'n temporibus Antichristi‚ quibus cum Dei gratia
facile esset obviare, si praelati et principes studium promo-
verent et secreta naturae et artis indagarent ¹.

¹ Bacon’s third prerogah’vr deals with the phenomena lying outside the
boundaries of any science recognized in his time, in which new departments
of knowledge were to be created by experiment and observation alone. Here
obviously the restraining influence of deduction from established principles
could be no longer exercised; and observation unguided by rational hypothesis,
led to strange results. For rules of induction, even faintly analogous to those
of the Novum Organum‚ the student of the Opus Majus will seek in vain. Yet
those who are disposed to be severe on the credulity of Roger Bacon, or olbis
century, will find it well matched if not surpassed in the Silva summm of his
namesake. We may go further. His description of the mutual attraction of
the split hezel-wanda is curiously suggestive of the procedure followed even
now by water-findere, who are not seldom consulted by practical men.

ln his attempt to handle scientifically the real or pretended wonders exhibited
by the wizards of bis time, and to sift true from false, Bacon showed singular
audacity ss well as insight. The few physicians of our time wbo have striven
to do the sarm with the allegations of clar-voyants, bave had to run the
gauntlet of imputations dangerous to their fame, though not. as in Bacon's
case, to liberty or life.
