quia occultatur, atque negat mixtionem principalium multi·
plicationum in locis ubi cadunt; et hoc concedo; et tum est
ibi mixtio quam dixi de foramine. Dico vero quod lux con-
siderata ut estin foramine absolute, oportet quod misceatur
naturali mixtione, et fiat una lux indivisa, et hoc non negat.
Sed si consideremus luces in foramine in quantum natae sunt
ad incessus rectos principales divisos post foramen, sicut ante,
sic dicuntur dividi et non misceri. Unde absolute loquendo
miscentur, sed respectu incessuum principalium diversorum,
in quos ipsae luces jam derivandae dicuntur esse in foramine,
divisae et distinctae. Sed sic esse distinctum eat aequivoce
acceptum, nec opponitur verae mixtioni absolute, quiahoc est
effective, non formaliter: solum enim in foramine dicuntur esse
distinctae, quia faciunt post foramen incessus distinctos, sicut
sol dicitur calidus, quia facit calorem, nunquia informetur
calore. Quicunque ergo vel stoici, vel philosophi, vel qui·
cunque sapientes antiqui dicunt, quod species lucis et coloris
vel aliae species simul sunt distinctae in medio, non est hoc

intelligendum absolute, sed quia faciunt incessus distinctos
principales ultra locum mixtionis, sicut ante ¹.

¹ 'lhe problem discussed by Bacon in the two foregoing chapters isone that
presented great difficulties to natural philosophem, not merely in antiquity and
in the middle ages, bnt down to a period at least as late as the middle of the
eighteenth century. Assuming that light, heat, or sound were conveyed to
our senses by progressive disturbances of the medium interposed between the
sensory urgan and the object apprehended (and this, as will be seen, was
Bacon's view), how was it that these lines of disturbance proceeding simul·
taueously from different objects or from different points in the sarm object
did not produce confusion when they intersectedl The explanation offered by
some that these lines of radiating force were of immaterial and spiritual
nature, and therefore like other spiritual things had no relation to space, Bacon
rejects as an untenable evasion of the difficulty: one of the barren solutions
characteristic of scholastic logie when nnimpregnated by acientilic rasearch. (Cf.
Mau. Sp. iii. a.) His own solution was that the line of force which impinged
vertically on the sense-orgen was so much more effectual than those which
fell upon it obliquely as to neutralize them. The solution was at least real,
so faras it went; though of course entirely insufficient. But it was much to
have conceived distinctly the importance of the problem. For a better solution
the world had to wait until Daniel Bemonlli solved the problem of the
coexistence of small oscillations3 proving that the oscillatione due to different
causes went on as though each took place separately. (Cf. Cornte, Pavonple
Poenum, i. 530, ed. Littre.)
